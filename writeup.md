## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

Answer:
Negative

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

Answer:
I think these labels are reliable. There seeems to be a consistency. It does not look biased at all. 

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

Answer:
An opportunity exists for this business to improve its product.
 
The reason is that although most of the customers left negative reviews for this product, several customers are satisfied and therefore, left a positive review. That means this product is not entirely bad. It has what some but not all customers want. 

I recommend this coconut water producer to find its deficiency by studying the user reviews and take actions to make improvements in those areas.
